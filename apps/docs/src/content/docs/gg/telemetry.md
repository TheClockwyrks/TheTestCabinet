title: "Telemetry"
---

Because gg is **part of The Test Cabinet**, it streams **far richer telemetry** back
than the normalized [event](/components/core/events/)/[metric](/components/core/metrics/)
contract requires, and the backend and console understand it **natively**. And
because gg is [headless](/gg/overview/#how-gg-fits-into-the-test-cabinet) — no TUI of
its own — this stream is the **only** live window into a run, which is why it is
first-party and rich rather than an afterthought.

The telemetry must let the console display:

- **[Epics and issues](/gg/epics-and-issues/)** and their statuses (the live board).
- The **[agents/subagents](/gg/subagents/)** that are running, and the **tree** they
  form.
- For each agent, whether it is **actively executing or blocked** waiting on other
  agents.
- The **[context-window breakdown](/gg/context-visibility/)** over time — the
  stacked line graph.

The very first event of a session, `session_started`, carries the run's whole
[capability set](/gg/overview/#the-capability-set). That is what lets a console shape
itself to the run from the moment it starts watching rather than only once the run
record lands: the live monitor (and a finished run's gg tab) offers exactly the
panels the run's configuration justifies, so a run with no epic/issue board and no
planning pass is never asked to show an empty Board or Plan. A stream recorded before
gg announced it simply omits the field, and the recorded set on the run record stands
in.

This telemetry is **custom** — a purpose-built structured stream to The Test
Cabinet, designed to carry the live, hierarchical, high-cardinality state above (the
agent tree and the issue board), which pure metrics and plain spans model poorly. A
run **may also** export [OpenTelemetry](/development/observability/)
(spans/metrics/logs, as any run can), but the **primary** telemetry is the custom
channel, not OTel.

It rides an **additional channel** on top of the standard harness contract, so a gg
run is still a valid, scoreable run with the extended telemetry stripped (see
[Overview → How gg fits into The Test Cabinet](/gg/overview/#how-gg-fits-into-the-test-cabinet)).
The custom schema is what [result aggregation](/gg/result-aggregation/) queries, so
the two are designed together.
