// Coil — the vitest project the CASE's validators run as. CASE-PROVIDED.
//
// A project of its own, separate from the build's `vitest.config.ts` at the
// workspace root. The two never mix: the build's config names `src/**/*.test.ts`
// and measures coverage over `src/`, so the tests a build wrote are counted and
// covered on their own, and the verdict rests on the checks in this directory
// alone. A build cannot reach the verdict by writing a test, and a case's check
// cannot flatter the build's coverage.
//
//   npx vitest run                                       # the build's own tests
//   npx vitest run --config validation/vitest.config.ts  # the case's validators
//
// The root is the workspace, not this directory, so a validator resolves the
// build's modules by the same relative paths the build itself uses. It is derived
// from this file's own URL rather than from the working directory, so the command
// above works from anywhere.
//
// The environment is `node`. The engine takes every measurement from the
// `SurfaceMetrics` the harness supplies, and every reading comes from the
// engine's own object model, its events, and the draw commands it records, so
// these suites need no DOM.
