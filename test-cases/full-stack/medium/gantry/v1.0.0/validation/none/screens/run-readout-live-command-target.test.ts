// run/readouts — while a command is live, the run screen shows that axis's
// target.
//
// `specs/ui.md` § Run: the run screen's readouts show "Each axis's value and its
// command's target while one is live". This check decides the second half of
// that sentence in the affirmative direction: an axis carrying a live command
// has that command's target on screen. The negative direction — an axis with no
// live command showing no target — is its own check.
//
// THE TAPE PUTS THE THREE OTHER AXES SOMEWHERE FIRST so the target under test
// cannot be read off anything else. Its first step drives the trolley, the hoist
// and the grip to three settled values; its second commands the slew to `253`, a
// figure no other readout on the run screen carries and one the slew is nowhere
// near at the tick this reads. So the only way `253` reaches the screen is as
// the slew's live command target.
//
// THE SETTLED VALUES ARE THE NEAREST ONES THAT WILL DO. All the settling step
// has to leave behind is three figures that are not `253`; how far its axes
// travel to reach them decides nothing, and travel this reading does not use is
// only more of the axis controller standing between the point and its verdict.
//
// THE FIGURE IS LOOKED FOR ON THE SLEW'S OWN LINE. `specs/ui.md` puts the target
// beside its axis's value, so a readout that names the axis fixes the line, and
// the target has to be on it — which is also what stops another axis's readout
// from standing in for the one under test.
