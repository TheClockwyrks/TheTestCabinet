// simulation/breakage-cascade-within-one-tick — a breakage whose re-solve
// overloads another member takes both on the same tick.
//
// `specs/statics.md` § Utilization and breakage: "Both solves then run again at
// the same tick, over the members still intact, with the lumped masses and the
// applied forces recomputed for them, in the same order and under the same
// checks. Repeat until a pass breaks nothing or a pass fails."
//
// So the whole of the cascade belongs to ONE tick, and a build that let the next
// pass wait for the next tick is what this has to catch. The crane lifts a load
// heavy enough that its first solve finds two members over capacity, and heavy
// enough that the structure without those two puts two more over.
//
// THE RUN'S OWN LIST SAYS HOW MANY PASSES THERE WERE. The members that break
// "join the run's list of broken members in ascending member-id order" — per
// breakage, since that is the only way a list can be in ascending order at all
// while a later pass appends to it. So an id that appears AFTER a larger one can
// only have joined on a later pass, and this crane's list does exactly that:
// `{FIRST_PASS[0]}` and `{FIRST_PASS[1]}` first, then two smaller ids behind
// them. That is a second pass, and `run.tick` still reads `1`.

/**
 * The reference crane these checks are posed on, built on site 6 (Heavy Haul) for
 * its nine ground anchors and its `6000` budget.
 *
 * Ids are the order the members are listed in, which is the order `poseCrane`
 * places them and therefore the id each one carries in every force readout and
 * every `broken` entry (`specs/instrumentation.md`).
 *
 *   - `0`-`21`  the tower: a leg under each of the ring's four bottom-flange
 *               nodes, the flange square with both its horizontal diagonals, and
 *               inclined braces from every anchor the site gives, so no tower
 *               member is ever the weakest thing in the crane.
 *   - `22`-`30` the mast: two heads at `(0, 6, 0)` and `(0, 6, 2)`, each tied to
 *               all four top-flange nodes, and tied to each other.
 *   - `31`-`44` the jib: two chords out to `x = 8` at `z = 0` and `z = 2`, the
 *               rail among them, and the cross members that make the pair rigid.
 *   - `45`-`52` the stays: at `(4, 4, 0)` and `(4, 4, 2)` a stiff STRUT stay and
 *               a CABLE stay side by side, and four cables out to the jib tip.
 *
 * The trolley's track is the single rail `32`, from `(4, 4, 0)` to `(8, 4, 0)`.
 * Its origin is the end nearer the slew axis, `(4, 4, 0)`, so a run starts with
 * the trolley — and anything hanging from it — at that node.
