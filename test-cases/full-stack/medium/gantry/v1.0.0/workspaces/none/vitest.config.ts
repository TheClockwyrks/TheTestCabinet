// This config names the BUILD'S OWN tests: the `*.test.ts` files written beside
// the sources under `src/`. They run in process, in Node, with no browser and
// no DOM, so nothing that needs a `webgl2` context runs here. `@napi-rs/canvas`
// is installed for a test that wants a real 2D context to draw through.
//
// Coverage is measured over `src/` alone, so it reports the code this build
// actually ships. `passWithNoTests` keeps a build that has not written its tests
// yet reporting an honest zero rather than a runner error.
