// Floe — water/lane-lengths: SCAFFOLD STUB, NOT A VALIDATOR.
//
// The Validators stage of the Floe v3.0.0 rework replaces this file with the
// real suite for the `water.lane-lengths` review item, written
// against the `simple-2d` engine. Until then it FAILS, deliberately and loudly: a
// stub that passed would score the item a point the build never earned, and a
// stub the Validators stage forgot would be indistinguishable from a passing
// check.
//
// The item this file decides, from test-case.toml:
//
//   Each floe spans its stated tiles
//
//   A pan reports len 1, a raft3 3 and a raft4 4, on every lane that carries
//   one.
//
// Its declared media: image `scene`.
