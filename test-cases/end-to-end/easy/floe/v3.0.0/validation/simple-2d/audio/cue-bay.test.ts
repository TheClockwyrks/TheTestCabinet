// Floe — audio/cue-bay: SCAFFOLD STUB, NOT A VALIDATOR.
//
// The Validators stage of the Floe v3.0.0 rework replaces this file with the
// real suite for the `audio.cue-bay` review item, written
// against the `simple-2d` engine. Until then it FAILS, deliberately and loudly: a
// stub that passed would score the item a point the build never earned, and a
// stub the Validators stage forgot would be indistinguishable from a passing
// check.
//
// The item this file decides, from test-case.toml:
//
//   Filling a bay plays its cue
//
//   A hop into an open bay plays the bay cue.
//
// Its declared media: replay `bay`.
