// Floe — presentation/sprite-bear-run: SCAFFOLD STUB, NOT A VALIDATOR.
//
// The Validators stage of the Floe v3.0.0 rework replaces this file with the
// real suite for the `presentation.sprite-bear-run` review item, written
// against the `structured-2d` engine. Until then it FAILS, deliberately and loudly: a
// stub that passed would score the item a point the build never earned, and a
// stub the Validators stage forgot would be indistinguishable from a passing
// check.
//
// The item this file decides, from test-case.toml:
//
//   A bear on ice is drawn from its run frames
//
//   A bear travelling on the median in each of the four directions is drawn
//   from that direction's run pair (frames 0 to 7).
//
// Its declared media: image `scene`.
