// Fathom — the vitest project the CASE's validators run as. CASE-PROVIDED.
//
// A project of its own, separate from the build's `vitest.config.ts` at the
// workspace root. The two never mix: the build's config names `src/**/*.test.ts`
// and measures coverage over `src/`, so the tests a build wrote are counted and
// covered on their own, and the verdict rests on the checks in this directory
// alone. A build cannot reach the verdict by writing a test, and a case's check
// cannot flatter the build's coverage.
//
//   npx vitest run                                       # the build's own tests
//   npx vitest run --config validation/vitest.config.ts  # the case's validators
//
// The root is the workspace, not this directory, so a validator addresses the
// build's output by the same relative path the build itself produced it at. It is
// derived from this file's own URL rather than from the working directory, so the
// command above works from anywhere.
//
// WHY THIS PROJECT NEEDS SCAFFOLDING THE ENGINE-BACKED ONES DO NOT. An engineless
// build is a static site with nothing to import, so every check drives it in a
// real browser through `window.__fathom`. The one server and the one Chromium the
// whole project shares are started by a `globalSetup` before any suite runs, and
// each suite worker takes a page of that browser and gives it back through a
// `setupFiles` teardown; both land with the suites that need them. The
// environment stays `node` — the suites drive a browser, they do not run in one.
