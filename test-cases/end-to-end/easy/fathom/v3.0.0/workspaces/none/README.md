# Fathom — starter project

This repository is the starting point for building **Fathom**, the game the
specification under `specs/` describes. Read `specs/overview.md` first; it says
how the rest of the specification is organized.

This build runs on **no engine**. Nothing here supplies a frame loop, input,
audio, asset loading, or an overlay, and there is no game code to start from.
What the project supplies is the toolchain, already configured and installed:
TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, ESLint and Prettier, wired to the commands below.

## What you own

**Everything under `src/`.** The directory does not exist yet; create it.

`index.html` loads `/src/main.ts` as its entry point, so that module is where
your build starts. Beyond that the structure is yours. You write the runtime a
browser game needs: the frame loop and the delta time it measures, fitting the
fixed logical stage onto the canvas, keyboard input, pointer and touch input,
image loading, audio, and the diagnostics overlay. The game itself sits on top
of that runtime, and you write it too.

Fathom's art is seeded under `assets/`: seven sprite sheets covering the
forager, the three predators, the bonus drifter, the flare bloom, and the maze
tiles. Loading those frames and drawing them is part of what you build, and
`specs/assets.md` states what each sheet holds and how the game renders it.
Everything else the game shows is drawn in code.

You also write the `window.__fathom` debugging and automation API that
`specs/instrumentation.md` specifies. It is a required deliverable: it is how the
game is driven from code, so it is present and exactly as specified.

Every figure the specification fixes is stated in `specs/`, and the value stated
there is authoritative: the stage and tile-grid geometry, the speeds, the
sensing ranges and durations, the maze rules, the scoring, the key bindings, and
the cue names.

Tests you write belong beside your sources as `src/**/*.test.ts`. `npm test` runs
them in process, in Node, with coverage over `src/`. `@napi-rs/canvas` is
installed, so a test that needs a real 2D context can draw through one without a
browser.

## What you must not edit

- **`index.html`** — the page and the canvas.
- **`assets/`** — the art seeded with the project.
- **The toolchain** — `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`,
  `vitest.config.ts`, `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`,
  and `.gitignore`.

Add dependencies to `package.json` if you genuinely need them, and commit the
`package-lock.json` — the build is installed with `npm ci`. Leave the existing
entries and scripts alone.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — serves the game with hot reload.
- `npm run build` — type-checks, then emits the static site into `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — serves `dist/` for a final check.
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`.
- `npm run lint` — ESLint.
- `npm run format` — Prettier, in check mode.
- `npm test` — Vitest over `src/**/*.test.ts`, with coverage.

## What the finished repository satisfies

- `npm run build` produces `dist/` with `index.html` at its root, and that
  directory runs as-is on any static host.
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, and `npm test` all pass.
  The same four commands are run over the repository you leave behind.
- **Replace this file** with the `README.md` `specs/overview.md` asks the
  finished build to ship: what the game is, how to install it, how to run it in
  development, how to produce the production build, and the controls.
