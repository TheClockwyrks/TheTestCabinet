 * is to say each thing once, and the bulk of it in a game that draws procedurally
 * and so repeats almost nothing between frames.
 *
 * Every entry here is reached from a kept frame, and every reference inside one
 * is rewritten as it is reached, transitively: a frame names its own state and
 * the states saved under it, whose clip and path segments and inherited fill name
 * operations and resources, whose own creating calls may name images. What is
 * deduplicated is the rewritten entry, so an operation two hundred frames issue
 * identically is written once and named two hundred times, and every index a
 * frame carries addresses the table it was interned into.
 *
 * Exported for the package's own suite, which drives it over a recording a
 * browser cannot deliver: Playwright's serializer drops an own field named
 * `__proto__` on the way out of the page, so handing one to this directly is the
 * only way to check that the rewrite carries it.

 * the frame kept before it.
 *
 * The restatement is what makes a decimated recording play at the speed the game
 * really ran at: the deltas still sum to the section's elapsed time. The frame
 * `count` is left as it was recorded, so a reader can see that frames were
 * skipped rather than being told a smooth lie. The last frame is always kept
 * whatever the stride lands on — it is the frame the check's sweep stopped at,
 * and the one a reviewer looks at first.
 *
 * Keeping it costs a frame rather than the cap. The stride rounds up, so a
 * section whose length is an exact multiple of the cap strides over exactly that
 * many frames and stops one stride short of the end: the last frame still has to
 * come in, and the cap is a ceiling rather than a target. It takes the place of
 * the final strided frame — the frame nearest it, so the swap opens the smallest
 * gap available anywhere in the section — and is measured from where that frame
 * was measured from, which is what keeps the kept deltas summing to the elapsed
 * time.
 *
 * What survives is then re-expressed against tables of its own, so the file
 * carries what the kept frames draw with and nothing the dropped ones did.
